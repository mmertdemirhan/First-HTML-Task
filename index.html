    <h3>Hakkımda</h3>

    <p>Graduate of political science major and an amateur musician plays piano, guitar and baglama. After I amazed with the power and solidarity of the realm of programming and more specifically open source community, I recently decided to learn web development and found patika.dev which is a priceless society.</p>

    <h2>My Favourite Serie</h2>

    <h3>Snowpiercer</h3>

    <p>This serie is answering questions such as "How humanity can survive from a real climate diseaster like an ice age?", "Is it possible to have an equality inside of a train that 1001 cars long?". However, the most exciting thing about this serie is the eternal engine of Snowpiercer</p>

    <p>Even though the serie is not well-known I strongly suggest to my friends every time we speaking of series. You can find some logical errors but in my humble opinion it is an accepted side of the sci-fi productions</p>
